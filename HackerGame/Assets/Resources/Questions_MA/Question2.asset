  question: How does abstraction contribute to software design?
  answers:
  - By simplifying complex systems and emphasizing essential attributes while hiding
    implementation specifics.
  - By enforcing strict data hiding rules within classes.
  - By enabling dynamic method dispatch to optimize program performance.
  - By facilitating modularization through the use of interfaces.
