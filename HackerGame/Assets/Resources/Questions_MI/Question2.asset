  question: How does the "protected" access modifier differ from "private" and "public"
    in the context of inheritance?
  answers:
  - '"Protected" members are accessible within the class itself and by its subclasses
    (derived classes), whereas "private" members are only accessible within the class
    itself and "public" members are accessible from any other class.'
  - '"Protected" members are accessible from any other class, while "private" members
    are accessible within the class itself and its subclasses, and "public" members
    are accessible within the class itself.'
  - '"Protected" members are accessible only within the class itself, while "private"
    members are accessible within the class itself and by its subclasses, and "public"
    members are accessible from any other class.'
