  question: In C++, what is the difference between compile-time polymorphism and
    run-time polymorphism, and which one is achieved through function overriding?
  answers:
  - Compile-time polymorphism is resolved at compile time while run-time polymorphism
    is resolved at runtime. Function overriding achieves compile-time polymorphism.
  - Compile-time polymorphism is resolved at compile time while run-time polymorphism
    is resolved at runtime. Function overriding achieves compile-time polymorphism.
  - Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function overloading while run-time
    polymorphism is achieved through function overriding.
  - Compile-time polymorphism and run-time polymorphism are synonymous terms in C++.
