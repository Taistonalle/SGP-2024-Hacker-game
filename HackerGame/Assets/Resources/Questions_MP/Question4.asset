  question: What is the significance of the 'final' keyword in C++11 regarding polymorphism?
  answers:
  - It indicates that a virtual function cannot be overridden in any derived class.
  - It prevents a base class from being inherited, thus restricting polymorphism.
  - It ensures that an object of a derived class cannot be implicitly converted to
    a base class object.
  - It forces all derived classes to override a specific virtual function.
