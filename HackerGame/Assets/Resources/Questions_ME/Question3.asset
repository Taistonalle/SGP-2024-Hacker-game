  question: How does encapsulation promote data integrity and security in software
    development?
  answers:
  - By encapsulating sensitive data within the object and controlling access through
    methods.
  - By allowing unrestricted access to all object properties.
  - By providing direct access to object properties from external code.
  - By enforcing a rigid hierarchy of classes.
