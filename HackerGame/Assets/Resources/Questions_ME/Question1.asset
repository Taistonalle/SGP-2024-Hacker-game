  question: In object-oriented programming, what is the primary goal of encapsulation?
  answers:
  - To restrict access to certain components of an object and enforce controlled
    interaction.
  - To expose all internal details of an object for easy manipulation.
  - To minimize the size of objects to improve memory efficiency.
  - To eliminate the need for inheritance and polymorphism.
